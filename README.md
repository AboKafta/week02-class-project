## Purpose
Reads voltage and resistance and gives current with Ohm's Law

## Input Format
voltage and resistance (in V and ohms) seperated by a space

## Output
- Valid input gives: `Current: value A`
- Invalid input gives: `Invalid Input`

## Build and run
```bash
mkdir -p build
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic src/main.cpp -o build/app
.build/app
```

```bash
bash test.sh
```
Prints `All acceptance tests passed` if every test is passes. GitHub runs this test on every push and pull request

## Example
```
$ echo "12 4" | ./build/app
Current: 3 A
$ echo "12 0" | ./build/app
Invalid input
```

## Limitations
- Extra text is ignored
- Negative voltages are not checked
- 6 sig figs only

## Debugging Reflection
- A lot of the time, the file wasn't saved so compiling didn't work and bash didn't recognize a file.
- One test failed cause I had 3A instead of 3 A
